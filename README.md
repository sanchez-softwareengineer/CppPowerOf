# CppPowerOf

**Description**

PowerOf is a C++ application that calculates the power of a number using both iterative and recursive methods. The program demonstrates fundamental C++ programming concepts such as loops, recursion, and basic mathematical operations. It allows users to input a base and an exponent, then computes and displays the result using different techniques.

**Features**

- **Iterative Power Calculation:** Computes the power of a number using an iterative approach.
- **Recursive Power Calculation:** Computes the power of a number using a recursive approach.
- **Result Display:** Outputs the result of the power calculation, including the original exponent for reference.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (or any C++ compiler)
- Git (optional for cloning the repository)

**Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   To clone the repository, use the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/PowerOf.git
2. **Open the Project**

   Open the cloned repository in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 by double-clicking the `.sln` file or using the "Open Project" option in Visual Studio.

3. **Build the Project**

   Build the project using Visual Studio by selecting `Build` from the top menu and then `Build Solution` or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B`.

4. **Run the Application**

   Run the application from within Visual Studio by pressing `F5` or selecting `Start Debugging` from the top menu.

**Usage**

1. **Enter Base and Exponent**

   When prompted, input the base and exponent values.

2. **View Results**

   The application will display the result of the power calculation using both iterative and recursive methods.

**File Structure**

- `PowerOfDriver.cpp`: Contains the main function and handles user input for both iterative and recursive power calculations.
- `PowerOf.h`: Defines any necessary functions or classes related to power calculation.
- `.sln file`: Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.
- `.vcxproj file`: Microsoft Visual Studio project file.
